# VMwareReport

For the snapshot size, neither VMware web client nor API provide the correct size for 'sesparse' disks', this script read and sum the real snapshot file(VMDK) size to count.

The function will provide these info. 
vCenter, OS, VM, Name, Description, CreatedTime, CreatedBy, SizeGB

Hope it can help some folks need it.
Comments and suggestion, it is welcome.
